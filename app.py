    st.markdown('Suicide is a significant public health issue, with an estimated 703,000 deaths worldwide each year. It is often associated with a history of mental health disorders, particularly depression. The differentiation between depression and suicidal ideation is a challenging task for the medical field. With the shift in human communication from real to virtual, social media has become a preferred medium for expressing thoughts, emotions, and feelings. Social media can be leveraged to detect early warning signs related to suicide, such as self-harm and depression. NLP techniques have been used to detect suicidal ideation from text data, including social media posts. However, there is still a need for more robust and accurate methods for suicide detection on social media.')
    
    st.subheader('Problem Statement')
    st.markdown('Psychological health, citizen‚Äôs emotional and mental well being, is one of the most neglected public health issues. These mental health issues are still ignored due to social stigma and lack of awareness. In addition, the cost to get clinical diagnosis of these mental health is expensive and many of the ones who suffer depression use social media to talk about their problem. \n\nTo address this issue, we propose a system that utilizes deep learning techniques to detect suicide ideation on social media platforms, specifically using Reddit datasets for training and testing the model. This project aims to improve early detection and intervention for individuals at risk of suicide, ultimately reducing the negative impact of mental health issues on society')
